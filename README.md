# Natro Search Engine

**AI-powered search engine built on Solana for intelligent, data-driven results.**

Natro Search is the core intelligence layer behind the [Natro Browser](https://natro.io).  
It introduces a new approach to web search by combining artificial intelligence, structured data, and the Solana blockchain.

---

## Overview

Natro Search processes and ranks information dynamically using AI models connected to both on-chain and off-chain data sources.  
It delivers contextually relevant, adaptive, and verifiable results while contributing to Natro’s data-driven ecosystem.

---

## Features

- **AI-based query ranking** — contextual and adaptive search results  
- **Integration with Solana** — data validation and contribution tracking  
- **Modular API** — can be embedded into browser or third-party tools  
- **Scalable indexing** — hybrid architecture for fast data retrieval
